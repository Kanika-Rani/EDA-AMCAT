# Exploratory Data Analysis Project on AMCAT Data
### Overview
This project involves the analysis of an AMCAT dataset to explore and understand various aspects related to students' academic and skill performance, their job placements, and other factors influencing their career outcomes. The goal was to gain insights that could help businesses, educational institutions, and fresh graduates align their efforts to meet market needs and trends.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information on students' academic scores, technical and soft skills, job cities, specializations, and other relevant features. It includes the following columns:
* Academic Scores (10th, 12th, College GPA)
* Skills (Technical and Soft Skill Scores)
* Job Designation, Job City
* Gender, Specialization, etc.
### Objectives
* Understand the correlation between academic performance and job outcomes.
* Identify patterns in job locations, specializations, and designations.
* Explore the influence of skills on salary and job roles.
* Handle data cleaning and manipulation challenges to prepare data for analysis.
### Key Findings
* Academic performance plays a role, but skills and specialization are critical in career outcomes.
* Salary distribution shows variation based on skills, location, and job designations.
* The preference for job cities varies significantly, with a few cities dominating the job market.
* Soft skills like communication and problem-solving are important determinants in salary outcomes.
### Challenges Faced
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting misspelled values, and dealing with incorrect data entries (e.g., datetime values in categorical columns).
* Confusion & Excitement: As a beginner, there were times of confusion while figuring out how to approach the data, but seeing results and visuals made it worthwhile.
### Tools & Technologies Used
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
* Jupyter Notebook for interactive data analysis
### Conclusion
This project provided insights into the factors influencing career outcomes for fresh graduates. It highlights the importance of skills, specialization, and location in shaping job opportunities and salary.
